About the project
-----------------

A lotta of server along all of discord need to solve the problem of applications: many use ticket eco-system or third-party services.

So, this bot enters and solves some of this stuff: handling an applications, collecting them on database and allowing to rate them, administrate through admins and other.

Project wants to add some «commonness» with entire idea of applications collecting procedure through easy-to-understand system: write command, write application in specified channel and go on.

### Built-with

Plankton, which is how bot was named, is built with help of different super-sets, frameworks and other technologies (aka databases, programming languages, services):

<!-- There is a website, which contains icons for shields: 
* https://simpleicons.org/ 
* 
* Every icon is in SVG format, but on website there are only-white, when shields got 
* them colorized, if you want to decolozire your icon, use param of logo's color (read shield's docs).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- 
* Describe here how to start and debug your project locally, we are talking here how to
* setup your project for a dev environment stuff: any prerequisites for project, instructions,
* add-on guidelines.
 -->

Getting started
---------------

Project may seem a little-one fella, but it contains a lot of underwater stones, so read this chapter for avoiding some future problems and dilemmas.

### Prerequisites

Before downloading the source code or using this project ensure you met the following requirements:

- Installed [Node.js](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/) on your desktop on which you will edit/setup this project;
- Globally installed typescript's and prisma's packages: there is an [advanced article by Sabin Adams](https://sabinadams.hashnode.dev/starting-a-prisma-typescript-project) about jumping into those things;

### Installations

Planktons doesn't have any published package-like code or tags with compiled versions of the bot, so only-one path to use this bot is downloading its source code and setup it on your own.

Guideline for installation of source code of the project:

1. Clone the repository with any form of app which supports git (or CLI of this site) - [guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) is attached;
2. Put this application in your path of project and define its namespace if required;
3. Project is ready to be used, debugged or edited in your IDE either text editor;

<!-- PROJECT'S USAGE -->
<!-- Comments from the author:
* Write here, an example, where your bot can be used: can add screenshots, codes, demos or links to other
* resources: just scream, how and when reader can use this project.
 -->

Usage
-----

Main usage of Plankton is just do things with applications and there is no higher goal to it: just do thing with them.

What is this things with applications?

1. Collect them.
2. Administrate them with human factor: admins will check them on moment of different stuff.
3. Publish them on public view and save them into database for futher processing.
4. Judge and rate them - members with specified roles will be able to got a number of applies and rate them.

**But there is on thing about this bot's first open source code: it was personally written for one client, so, if you want different functions and visualizations, gotta do them by yourself.**

* Write a long-time roadmap for this project: my direct
* recommendations to not often edit roadmap excluding progress of tasks.
 -->

Roadmap

<!-- PROJECT'S CONTRIBUTING -->
<!-- Contributors, contributing guidelines and other:
* Here you can type random contributors or simply write a contributing
* guideline/reference a contributing policy here.
*
* Github is an open source community, so I highly recommend you to setup
* this block of your project.
 -->

Contributing
------------

Contributions are what make open source community such an interest place to be in - so any form of contribution are greatly appreciated.

If you think that you can help this project become better but think its not so important/realizable in the current situtation or for a full contribution, use issues block, otherwise there is a guideline and policy for contributing.

If you have a suggestion that will improve this project: fork the repository and create a pull request:

1. Fork the repository;
2. Clone the repository with help of any git's client;
3. Make your changes;
4. Stage made changes and push them - [step-by-step guide](https://dev.to/mrfrontend/git-101--step-2-add-stage-commit--push-3p3p) is attached;
5. Create a pull request;
6. Squash commits for cleaner history;

For one-single file contributioning, use a more quicker way without forking the repository through website;

More about it in this article: in [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork/) about syncing one-file fork.
